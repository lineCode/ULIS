 Display class version

The sRGB_v4_ICC_preference.icc profile is of the profile class 'colorspace'. While ICC recommends this version is used, some applications fail to recognize colorspace class profiles. A workaround for such cases is to use a 'display' class version (identical in all respects except for the profile class field in the header, and the profileID value). The display class version is subject to the same terms of use as the colorspace class version.
