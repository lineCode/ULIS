/// @class      FDevice
/// @brief      The FDevice class provides a mean of fetching and reading
///             informations about the CPU in a single-CPU, multicore environment.
///
/// @details    FDevice provides functions to fetch wether support for 64bit
///             features or SIMD extensions are supported on the CPU that runs
///             the compiled code, at runtime. It has no relation wathsoever with
///             the computer that compiled the code in the first place, it is a
///             cross platform way of detecting wether the consumer of the library
///             code is able to rely on the implementations compiled with these
///             SIMD features in mind. Additionnaly, it provides extra information
///             about the CPU vendor, and some information about the OS is relation
///             to its support for the features sets or for 64bit features, although
///             64bit is always assumed to be true within ULIS.
///
///             FDevice also provides some insight about the hardware such as the
///             number of available cores, or the size of cache lines.
